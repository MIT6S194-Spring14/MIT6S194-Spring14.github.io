Reading before hackathon
------------------------

[All I Really Need to Know I Learned in
Kindergarten](http://www.peace.ca/kindergarten.htm), by Robert L.
Fulghum. (You don't have to read the book, just the contents of the
link).

 

You are going to meet a lot of people during the weekend, but after
that, communication will be much harder. Please go through the following
paper by Gutwin, Penner, and Schneider, [Group Awareness in Distributed
Software
Development](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/40369965/6s194/papers/Group_Awareness_in_OSS.pdf).

(You have access to it through MIT library if you need the full
reference).)

Thursday : Cancelled for traveling
----------------------------------

No class due to traveling to the Facebook hackathon

Homework
--------

(due date: Feb 11 in class): Travel Log

I want you all to keep a diary of the activities you go through at the
hackathon. You will be (informally) presenting this in class on Tuesday
11 (first class after traveling).

 

The format is open, but you will at least need to add a few paragraphs
of what happened in each of the sessions, info of the tasks you are
working on, and a picture of you with your mentor (yes, this is
mandatory; if they don't want to be in your picture, let me know).

 

You can do this as a group if you want (and there's more than one of you
in your project), but I want to see individual paragraphs.

 

2 minutes per person for the presentation (groups of 2 people will have
6 minutes, and so on). Your entry can be longer, but you will only have
to tell us about the main parts.

You can do this as a google doc, as a blog entry, G+ entry, or whatever
you want, as long as I can load it in my laptop to project in class
while you tell us about it.

Please also add a paragraph with your expectations for the semester and
plan of action as part of your travel log.
