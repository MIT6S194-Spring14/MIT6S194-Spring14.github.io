## Goal

A way for you to practice communicating, critiquing, and iterating technical design.

## Presenter Role

When you are acting as presenter, your role is to communicate your work in a way
that both conveys its technical design and also the reason why this work was
necessary. A presentation should last about ten minutes. A good breakdown for
these ten minutes would be:

**Introduction**: One or two sentences about what you're going to be presenting.

**2 Minutes**: Broader context of the problem.

What is the software involved and who uses it?
What is the particular area of the software that you've been working in? (i.e.,
the database layer, the reporting code, the front-end interface). Who uses this
layer software? What is its significance to the project? What is its design
philosophy? Its goals?

For example, if you are working on a bug-fix for a database library, explain the
database library to us -- who uses it? Why? What is its overall design
philosophy? How does it integrate with other components?

**3 Minutes**: Technical overview of the feature, bug, or design task that you have
been working on. Why is it important or necessary? How will it affect users?
What technical details are involved? What are some of the risks and tradeoffs
involved? What is interesting or hard about this problem? If relevant, have code
prepared to show.

**2-3 Minutes**: Your solution, even if its still in progress. Why did you make the
choices you did. Have code prepared to show
Audience Role

The audience has the responsibility to ask questions which probe the design
space and the presenters decisions. Avoid problem solving: this is a space to
understand and critique a particular idea rather than solve problems.

The second role of the audience is to provide feedback. Focus on how or why the
proposed design is good or unfitting for the problem. This includes both
technical (i.e., code technique) and design feedback.

## Keep in Mind

**Be expedient and to the point.**

Appreciate and respect the importance of "ordinary" technical decisions.
Especially at MIT, we all have a tendency to disregard technically easy things
as being uninteresting. Do not. We aren't interested in the technical difficulty
of solutions here. We are interested how and why you decided your solution is
the right solution. And the challenge of picking the right solution is nearly
always interesting to talk about, even if all the choices you are choosing
between are technically simple to implement.
